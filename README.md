# freduse
Stata command to import Federal Reserve economic data

This updates David Drukker's very helpful command for importing data from [FRED](http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/) to handle a recent change to the data format. The command uses the same syntax as the original `freduse` command and has the same version requirements. 

See also the recent [`fredusex`](https://www.statalist.org/forums/forum/general-stata-discussion/general/1761795-fredusex-regains-access-to-the-federal-reserve-economic-data-fred-database) command which also handles the updated data format, but requires Stata 16.
